This project had also many issue too:                                                                                                                //
->It's not a responsive website.                                                                                                                     //
->It doesn't have it's own specific data base where it can store data.                                                                               //
->It had also some color matching issues too.(Because I am not good in color matching.And I think a good color matcher can able to do this.('=')" ). //
